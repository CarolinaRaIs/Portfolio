        <p>Carolina was born in Mexico City Mexico and raised in Wilsonville, Oregon. She went to Oregon State University
        to obtain her bachelorâ€™s degree in chemical engineering and became a process engineer and teacher after her
        graduation. The fast-pace innovation and creativity in tech, as well as her desire to explore more topics in the
        STEM field inspired Carolina to continue her education as a full-stack web developer. Carolina has dived into
        impactful projects that showcase her technical abilities but she also understands the importance of using her
        diverse background to create a unique product. Carolina is a patient learner, artist, author, teacher, engineer,
        and potentially your next collaborator. </p>
